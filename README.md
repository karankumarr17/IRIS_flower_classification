## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.  
It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  
- Species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)

This project aims to:
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize relationships between features  
3. Train a classification model  
4. Evaluate model performance  
5. Save the trained model
